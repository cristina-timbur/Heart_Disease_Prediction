You may wonder how a single cell then goes on to form such\\nlarge organisms. Growth and reproduction are characteristics of cells,\\nindeed of all living organisms. All cells reproduce by dividing into two,\\nwith each parental cell giving rise to two daughter cells each time they\\ndivide. These newly formed daughter cells can themselves grow and divide,\\ngiving rise to a new cell population that is formed by the growth and\\ndivision of a single parental cell and its progeny. In other words, such\\ncycles of growth and division allow a single cell to form a structure\\nconsisting of millions of cells.\\n\\n10. 1 CELL CYCLE\\n\\nCell division is a very important process in all living organisms. During\\nthe division of a cell, DNA replication and cell growth also take place. All\\nthese processes, i.e., cell division, DNA replication, and cell growth, hence,\\nhave to take place in a coordinated way to ensure correct division and\\nformation of progeny cells containing intact genomes. The sequence of\\nevents by which a cell duplicates its genome, synthesises the other\\nconstituents of the cell and eventually divides into two daughter cells is\\ntermed cell cycle. Although cell growth (in terms of cytoplasmic increase)\\nis a continuous process, DNA synthesis occurs only during one speciﬁc\\nstage in the cell cycle. The replicated chromosomes (DNA) are then\\ndistributed to daughter nuclei by a complex series of events during cell\\ndivision. These events are themselves under genetic control.\\n\\n2019-2020',\n",
    "    '164\\n\\nYou have studied\\nmitosis in onion root\\ntip cells. It has 16\\nchromosomes in\\neach cell. Can you\\ntell how many\\nchromosomes will\\nthe cell have at G1\\nphase, after S phase,\\nand after M phase?\\nAlso, what will be the\\nDNA content of the\\ncells at G1, after S\\nand at G2, if the\\ncontent after M\\nphase is 2C?\\n\\nBiowGY\\n\\nSome cells in the adult animals do not appear to exhibit division (e.g.,\\nheart cells) and many other cells divide only occasionally, as needed to\\nreplace cells that have been lost because of injury or cell death. These\\ncells that do not divide further exit G1 phase to enter an inactive stage\\ncalled quiescent stage (Go) of the cell cycle. Cells in this stage remain\\nmetabolically active but no longer proliferate unless called on to do so\\ndepending on the requirement of the organism.\\n\\nIn animals, mitotic cell division is only seen in the diploid somatic\\ncells. However, there are few exceptions to this where haploid cells divide\\nby mitosis, for example, male honey bees. Against this, the plants can\\nshow mitotic divisions in both haploid and diploid cells. From your\\nrecollection of examples of alternation of generations in plants (Chapter 3)\\nidentify plant species and stages at which mitosis is seen in haploid cells.\\n\\n10.2 M PHASE\\n\\nThis is the most dramatic period of the cell cycle, involving a major\\nreorganisation of virtually all components of the cell. Since the number of\\nchromosomes in the parent and progeny cells is the same, it is also called as\\nequational division. Though for convenience mitosis has been divided\\ninto four stages of nuclear division (karyokinesis), it is very essential to\\nunderstand that cell division is a progressive process and very clear-cut\\nlines cannot be drawn between various stages. Karyokinesis involves\\nfollowing four stages:\\n\\n0 Prophase\\no Metaphase\\no Anaphase\\no Telophase\\n\\n1 0.2.1 Prophase\\n\\nProphase which is the first stage of karyokinesis of mitosis follows the\\nS and G2 phases of interphase. In the S and G2 phases the new DNA\\nmolecules formed are not distinct but intertwined. Prophase is marked\\nby the initiation of condensation of chromosomal material. The\\nchromosomal material becomes untangled during the process of\\nchromatin condensation (Figure 10.2 a). The centrosome, which had\\nundergone duplication during S phase of interphase, now begins to move\\ntowards opposite poles of the cell. The completion of prophase can thus\\nbe marked by the following characteristic events:\\n\\n0 Chromosomal material condenses to form compact mitotic\\nchromosomes. Chromosomes are seen to be composed of two\\nchromatids attached together at the centromere.\\n\\nO Centrosome which had undergone duplication during interphase,\\nbegins to move towards opposite poles of the cell. Each centrosome\\nradiates out microtubules called asters. The two asters together\\n\\nwith spindle fibres forms mitotic apparatus.\\n\\n2019-2020',\n",
    "    'TRANSPORT IN PLANTS\\n\\nmembrane. This movement is dependent on the gradient. The apoplast\\ndoes not provide any barrier to water movement and water movement is\\nthrough mass ﬂow. As water evaporates into the intercellular spaces or\\nthe atmosphere, tension develop in the continuous stream of water in the\\napoplast, hence mass ﬂow of water occurs due to the adhesive and cohesive\\nproperties of water.\\n\\nThe symplastic system is the system of interconnected protoplasts.\\nNeighbouring cells are connected through cytoplasmic strands that\\nextend through plasmodesmata. During symplastic movement, the water\\ntravels through the cells — their cytoplasm; intercellular movement is\\nthrough the plasmodesmata. Water has to enter the cells through the\\ncell membrane, hence the movement is relatively slower. Movement is again\\ndown a potential gradient. Symplastic movement may be aided by\\ncytoplasmic streaming. You may have observed cytoplasmic streaming\\nin cells of the Hydrilla leaf; the movement of chloroplast due to streaming\\nis easily visible.\\n\\nMost of the water ﬂow in the roots occurs via the apoplast since the\\ncortical cells are loosely packed, and hence offer no resistance to water\\nmovement. However, the inner boundary of the cortex, the endodermis,\\nis impervious to water because of a band of suberised matrix called the\\ncasparian strip. Water molecules are unable to penetrate the layer, so\\nthey are directed to wall regions that are not suberised, into the cells\\nproper through the membranes. The water then moves through the\\nsymplast and again crosses a membrane to reach the cells of the xylem.\\nThe movement of water through the root layers is ultimately symplastic\\nin the endodermis. This is the only\\nway water and other solutes can\\nenter the vascular cylinder.\\n\\nOnce inside the xylem, water is\\nagain free to move between cells as\\nwell as through them. In young\\nroots, water enters directly into the\\nxylem vessels and / or tracheids.\\nThese are non-living conduits and\\nso are parts of the apoplast.
